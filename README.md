 # Project Question for Full Stack .NET Developer: Building a Task Management System
---
## Project Overview
You are tasked with developing a Task Management System for a small-to-medium-sized company. The system should allow users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. Additionally, users should be able to assign tasks to specific individuals and set due dates. The application needs to be well-organized, follow clean coding principles, and adhere to best practices in both the backend and frontend development.

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
- Use ASP.NET Core for the backend.
Implement a relational database to store task data (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, or SQLite).
Include appropriate database relationships to handle tasks, users, and task assignments.
Implement CRUD operations for tasks.
Ensure proper error handling and validation.
Frontend
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
Develop a clean and responsive user interface for managing tasks.
Implement views for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
Include a user-friendly task listing page with filtering options.
Ensure a smooth user experience with AJAX or other relevant technologies.
User Authentication
Implement user authentication to differentiate between different users.
Ensure that only authenticated users can create, update, or delete tasks.
Users should only see and manage tasks assigned to them.
Best Practices
Follow RESTful API principles for backend development.
Apply SOLID principles and design patterns in your code.
Use Entity Framework or a similar ORM for database interactions.
Employ proper exception handling and logging.
Testing
Write unit tests for critical backend functionality.
Ensure that the frontend is thoroughly tested, covering different scenarios.
Additional Considerations
Use version control (e.g., Git) for managing the source code.
Provide clear and concise documentation for setting up and running the application.
Consider scalability and performance optimizations.
Submission
Share your project source code via a version control platform (e.g., GitHub) and provide instructions for running the application locally. Include a brief document summarizing the architecture, design decisions, and any additional notes you would like to share.

Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of features.
Code structure, organization, and readability.
Adherence to best practices and coding standards.
User interface design and responsiveness.
Handling of edge cases and errors.
Testing approach and coverage.
Good luck!
